<p>Soccer is my favorite sport to watch. I usually don't play soccer that much because i am not much of a athletic person. I think watching soccer much more interesting because I like to see my favorite soccer stars play on the field. Soccer is sport based to teamwork, Teams who have good chemistry between their players always have a high chance of success in a game. I always enjoy watching soccer</p>

<p>Travelling is also one of my favorite things to do. I always like to visit new places and meet new people. Most vital thing about travelling is getting to see beautiful places and extra-ordinary architecture. I hope to travel to different parts of the world when i am done with my studies.</p>
