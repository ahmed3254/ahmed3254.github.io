<h2>My name is muhammad ahmed</h2>
<p> I am Muhammad, and i go to hoffman estates high school. It is my last year in high school, and i would be going to college next year. I came to USA two years ago from Pakistan. I lived in Columbus, Ohio in the first year, and later moved to Ilinois when i was in junior in high school.
</p>
<p>I spend my childhood days in Pakistan. They were the best days of my life because i had alot of friends there. When i came to USA i kinda got isolated from my friends, but never attempted to make new friends here. I usually spend my time indoors playing video game, but i pay alot of attention to my studies also. I always try to be at the top of my class, and work hard to secure A grade in my classes </p>
